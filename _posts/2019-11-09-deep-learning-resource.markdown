Today, neural network and deep learning are more and more popular but what materials to learn will create a little headache due to the huge numbers of resources online. Different people have different tastes. Someones like online tutorials, some take Coursera courses. For me, I prefer learning neural networks and its application from courses of some big universities (e.g. Stanford, Berkeley, CMU). I like courses with slides, lecture notes, lecture record and homeworks. For this reason, I summarize these courses, categorize them according to their difficulty; I try to keep the post updated.

## Beginner

In this section, I will list some courses that provide foundation for neural network learning.

1. [Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1478831) from UC Berkeley.
2. [Stats 202: Data Mining and Analysis](http://web.stanford.edu/class/stats202/) from Stanford. They also include some solutions for homework.

## Intermediate

After learning foundation about neural network, we move to some of its applications

1. [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) from Stanford (Winter 2019). The note and materials are fantastic. Chris Manning is also a big name in the field. Must try course.
2. [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/) from Stanford (2016). An other masterpiece. It will help you understand the whole neural network application for computer vision.

## Advanced

We move forward to more advanced technique of deep learning. 

1. [CS 285 Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) from Berkeley. It helps us to understand deep RL. There is another course from [Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html) but I feel that the materials of Stanford are not that details to follow.
2. [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) from Stanford. It is so advanced, be careful.
3. [Convex Optimization](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A). The instructor is Stephen Boyd. He is a god in this field. Follow the [sequence](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364B) if you enjoy the course.

## Bonus 

Some useful materials for neural network

1. [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) from Harvard. It is for us to understand Transformer - an attention neural network.
2. [How to Escape Saddle Points Efficiently](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/08/31/saddle-efficiency/) from Berkeley. I think the title says all, I dont need to explain :)

Hopefully, these courses are useful for your study.
